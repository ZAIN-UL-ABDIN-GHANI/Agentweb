  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks to model complex patterns in data. By simulating the human brain's structure, deep learning enables machines to learn from large datasets, perform classification, and generate predictions with unprecedented accuracy.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">What is Deep Learning?</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Deep learning involves layers of interconnected neurons that process data hierarchically. Each layer extracts higher-level features from the raw input, enabling sophisticated representations and pattern recognition.
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Receives raw data like images, text, or audio.</li>
    <li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Multiple layers process features and learn complex patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> Produces predictions or classifications based on learned features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">Popular Neural Network Architectures</h2>
  <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Best for image and video analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Handle sequential data like text and time series.</li>
    <li><strong>Transformers:</strong> Power modern NLP models like GPT and BERT.</li>
    <li><strong>Autoencoders:</strong> Used for data compression and anomaly detection.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">Applications of Deep Learning</h2>

  <div class="mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-300 mb-2">1. Computer Vision</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Deep learning enables machines to interpret images and videos. Applications include facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and object detection.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-300 mb-2">2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Transformers and RNNs power language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and automated content generation. Deep learning allows machines to understand context and semantics.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-300 mb-2">3. Speech Recognition and Synthesis</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Deep learning models convert speech to text and vice versa. Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant rely on these models for accurate understanding and responses.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-300 mb-2">4. Healthcare and Drug Discovery</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Deep learning helps analyze medical images, predict disease progression, and even assist in discovering new drugs by modeling complex molecular interactions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">Challenges in Deep Learning</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Data Requirements:</strong> Needs large amounts of labeled data to train effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Computational Cost:</strong> Training deep networks requires GPUs or TPUs.</li>
    <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> Models can act as black boxes, making decisions hard to interpret.</li>
    <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> Models may memorize data instead of learning general patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">Best Practices</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
    <li>Use transfer learning with pre-trained models to save resources.</li>
    <li>Regularize models with dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation.</li>
    <li>Continuously validate and test models with unseen data.</li>
    <li>Document model behavior for reproducibility and ethical compliance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
    Deep learning is reshaping the AI landscape, unlocking capabilities that were previously unimaginable. From computer vision to natural language understanding, deep learning models are at the core of modern AI innovation.
